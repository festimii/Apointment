# Barber Shop Appointment App

This repository contains a minimal appointment application for a barber shop. The backend is built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**, and the frontend uses **Node.js** with simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## Backend

The backend lives in the `backend/` directory.
- `main.py`: FastAPI application with CRUD endpoints for appointments.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

To run the backend (requires a running MongoDB instance on `localhost:27017`):

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend

The frontend lives in the `frontend/` directory and uses an Express server to serve static files.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

This serves the HTML/CSS/JS from `frontend/public` on `http://localhost:3000`.
The frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend to list, create and delete appointments.
